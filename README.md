# Introduction to Data Science 2020 Semester A  Final Project
 
This is a final project in 'Introduction to Data Science' course.
During the semester we learned about models used to predict outcomes for classification-type problems and regression-type problems.
We learned about the difference between the two types of prediction:
A classification classifies the data according to the classes to which the data belongs (e.g. dog or cat) while a regression predicts some amount (e.g. prediction of apartment prices) and will never be 100% accurate.

Notebook 1 is a solution to questions about probability, base law and random variables.

Notebook 2 is a solution to questions about the Python programming language. In this notebook I was writing codes to solve finding a particular data from a data set etc.

Notebook 3 and Notebook 4 are the notebooks that deal with classification and regression.

Classification:
The purpose of Notebook 3 is to classify whether a person is sick or not with heart disease according to various data such as age, blood pressure, etc. This notebook analyzes the information obtained from the data set to understand the relationship between the various factors and having heart disease.
After understanding the information, there is a use of different models which divide the data into training set and testing set, and after training on the training set the model tests his abilities on the testing set.
There is a comparison between the different models and finally choosing the best one.

Regression:
The purpose of Notebook 4 is to predict the price of a second hand car based on various data such as kilometers, number of years of use, engine horsepower, price on the road, etc. This notebook analyzes the information obtained from the data set to understand the relationship between the various factors and price of the cars, in order to be able to accurately predict the price of the car.
After understanding the information, there is a use of different models which divide the data into training set and testing set, and after training on the training set the model tests his abilities on the testing set.
There is a comparison between the different models and a comparison between taking parts of the data and using them only, in order to perhaps optimize the model.
From the results of the various models it is possible to understand who is the most accurate model for predicting the prices of second hand cars.
